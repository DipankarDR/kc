            <p class="nomargin c282828 bold pt15">Online NGO: </p>
            <p class="nomargin c282828 pt15 pb15">Our work revolves around the maintenance of a website, which processes donations on behalf of the NGOs and social campaigns. A transaction fee of 5% is to be paid for the services and the support that is provided by us. We also promptly donate to several good causes and NGOs and regret that the donations can only be refunded in few exceptional circumstances. It must be noted that we in no case process transactions and donations for a purpose that opposes public security, public policy and sovereignty of any state or country. We also do not promote any campaign or political idea. </p>
            <p class="nomargin c282828 bold">User conduct: </p>
            <p class="nomargin c282828 pt15 pb15">When you create a page in Krowdcircle.com, it is important that you know that Krowdcircle.com is for everybody.

            <p class="nomargin c282828 pt15 pb15">Your privacy is what matters to us. Our privacy policy is the replica of what we do and how we protect it. Krowdcircle.com is the trading name for the local Krowdcircle.com entity as identified in the country’s specific terms of service. All of these terms of service (and the relevant country specific terms) (together the ‘Terms of Service’) govern the use of the website along with the associated services.

This further includes non-charitable good causes and NGOs, which are referred to as Krowdcircle.com crowdfunding along with other listed organizations. Each cause that is featured comes with a mutual agreement with the website and authorizes Krowdcircle.com for collecting donations on its behalf. We have listed down the causes on the website on Krowdcircle.com’s discretion. The causes are based on the disclosures and representations made by individual/charity of such cause. However, it should be taken in concern that we in no way accept responsibilities of such causes. A charity needs to have appropriate authorization, license or permit to operate as a charity as are required by territory’s local laws. It is important for you to note that crowdfunding pages at Krowdcircle.com are not just intended for raising money. Hence, it is necessary for you to read the description carefully and be completely sure and satisfied for their suitability to receive donations. You should check and donate to the cause you intended. </p>
            <p class="nomargin c282828 bold">Donations: </p>
            <p class="nomargin c282828 pt15 pb15">Subject to the requirements of the applicable local laws, once the donation is made, it shall be refunded only when we have prior written content of the cause to whom the donation has been made. This is regardless of whether or not the donation is paid to the cause by Krowdcircle.com. Hence, it is initially crucial for you to get in touch with the NGO or any other cause initially. Before a donation is refunded, the relevant cause needs to agree that Krowdcircle.com might subject to the local applicable laws, deduct the entire amount to be refunded from subsequent payments that are to be made by Krowdcircle.com directed to the cause.<br><br>
Where payments of any nature are due to be made to such Cause within one (1) week of the refund being made to you, Krowdcircle.com reserves the sole right for invoicing the Cause for the refund. The cause further must agree to settle that invoice within one (1) month of the date of the invoice. We at Krowdcircle.com Crowdfunding, will charge your donation to your payment card account (or any other payment method available on the Website) at the time of donation. For donations made to Krowdcircle.com Crowdfunding, no refunds are to be provided, subject to applicable local laws. However, in situations when you do not agree to this condition, you should not make use of the Website for donating to Krowdcircle.com crowdfunding pages. Occasionally, person to have created the page where you have donated, do not pass identity verification or any other necessary checks, or there are distinct reasons for which the funds cannot be transferred to them. If this happens to a page where you have donated, we shall mail you and let you know that the donation will be sent to another good cause instead, subject to the deduction of any usual transaction along with payment processing fees (as described below). We understand that you might prefer to get the money back. In such a situation, a refund is requested.
